#### AT-10 The truck must have an analogic control system for velocity
#### AT-2 The truck must have the ability to change direction while going forward, reverse or being idle
#### AT-3 The truck must have right and left turn lights. 'Auto' and 'Manual' configurations
#### AT-11 The truck must have headlights. 'On', 'Off' and 'Auto' (based on light sensor) configurations
#### AT-4 The truck must have lights on the roof. 'On', 'Off' and 'Auto' (based on light sensor) configurations
#### AT-5 The truck must have the ability to load and unload the semi trailer
#### AT-6 The truck must have the ability to play audio signals stored in nonvolatile memory
#### AT-9 While reversing, the truck must inform the user of proximity to a rear obstacle using a beeping sound. 'On' and 'Off' configurations
#### AT-7 The truck must stop automatically if an obstacle is detected in its path while driving forward. 'On' and 'Off' configurations
#### AT-8 The truck must stop automatically if the weight of the load exceeds a configurable value


## Communication:
#### COM-1 The truck must communicate via Radiofrequency to a remote controller
#### COM-2 The truck must communicate via Bluetooth to an app used for diagnostics
#### COM-3 The different truck modules must communicate to each other via CAN bus
#### COM-4 The truck firmware must be updateable (either through bluetooth app or physical connection)
#### COM-6 The RF controller must have a touch-screen display with a simple interface to monitor the truck's status and sensors and to control the external LCD display
